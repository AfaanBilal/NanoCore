# NanoCore: An 8-bit CPU Emulator

## üåü Introduction

`NanoCore` is a meticulously crafted emulator for a custom 8-bit CPU.

Designed with extreme minimalism in mind, this CPU operates within a strict 256-byte memory space, with all registers, the Program Counter (PC), and the Stack Pointer (SP) being 8-bit.

This project serves as an educational exercise in understanding the fundamental principles of computer architecture, low-level instruction set design, memory management under severe constraints, and assembly language programming.

## ‚ú® Key Features

  * **True 8-bit Architecture:** All general-purpose registers (R0-R15), Program Counter (PC), and Stack Pointer (SP) are 8-bit.
  * **256-byte Memory:** The entire addressable memory space is limited to 256 bytes (`0x00` to `0xFF`), making it a challenge to write highly optimized and compact code.
  * **Variable-Length Instruction Set:** Supports both 1-byte, 2-byte and 3-byte instructions to maximize opcode efficiency and flexibility within the limited address space.
  * **Modular Design:** CPU cycle is broken down into distinct Fetch, Decode, and Execute phases for clarity.
  * **Inbuilt Two-Pass Assembler:** The NanoCore Assembler makes it easier to program it by writing NanoCore Assembly instead of direct machine code.

## üßÆ Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

> See `programs/` for example programs and compiled binaries.

NanoCore features a small but functional instruction set designed for its 8-bit constraints.

### Instruction Format

  * **1-byte instructions:** One 8-bit opcode.
  * **2-byte instructions:** An 8-bit opcode followed by an 8-bit operand (e.g., an immediate value or an address).
  * **3-byte instructions:** An 8-bit opcode followed by two 8-bit operands (e.g., an immediate value or an address).

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run the NanoCore emulator, you'll need to setup Rust locally.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AfaanBilal/nanocore.git
    cd nanocore
    ```
2.  **Run the example program:**
    The `programs/test.ncb` file contains a small, assembled program that demonstrates the CPU's basic functionality.
    ```bash
    cargo run -- programs/test.ncb
    ```
    You should see the emulator's debug output and the program's output to your console. The source assembly file is `programs/test.nca`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Assembling

To assemble a program (say `example.nca`), run the NanoCore Assembler (`nca`):
```bash
cargo r --bin nca -- -i example.nca -o example.ncb
```
This should assemble the `example.nca` (NanoCore Assembly) to `example.ncb` (NanoCore Binary).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running

To run this assembled binary, run:
```bash
cargo r -- example.ncb
```

## ü™Ñ Assemble and Run

To assemble and run without saving a binary:
```bash
cargo r -- example.nca
```
> Note that the filename MUST end with the `.nca` extension to be considered a NanoCore Assembly file which will be automatically assembled before running.

## üìü Terminal Interface

To run the TUI visualizer:
```bash
cargo r --bin tui -- programs/counter.nca
```

## üìÇ Code Structure

  * `CPU (cpu.rs)`: Defines the CPU's internal state, including registers, program counter, stack pointer, memory, and flag bits.
  * `NanoCore (nanocore.rs)`: The main emulator struct, responsible for loading programs, running cycles, and managing the `CPU`.
      * `NanoCore::new()`: Initializes a fresh computer state.
      * `NanoCore::load_program()`: Places machine code into the simulated memory.
      * `NanoCore::run()`: Executes the CPU cycle loop until halted.
      * `NanoCore::cycle()`: Performs a single CPU cycle (Fetch, Decode, Execute).
      * `NanoCore::fetch_decode()`: Reads the instruction byte(s) from memory and determines its type and operands.
      * `NanoCore::execute_instruction()`: Performs the operation defined by the decoded instruction, updating the CPU state.
  * `Assembler (assembler.rs)`: The NanoCore assembler core.
  * `Assembler bin (bin/nca.rs)`: The NanoCore assembler binary.
  * `TUI bin (bin/tui.rs)`: The NanoCore Terminal UI.
